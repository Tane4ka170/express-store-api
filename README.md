# Store API

Welcome to the Store API project! This repository contains the source code for a simple API built with Node.js and Express.js.

## Description

The Store API project is part of the Node.js / Express Course - Build 4 Projects tutorial. It serves as a backend solution for managing store data, including products, categories, and orders. This API provides endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, authentication, and authorization.

## Technologies Used
